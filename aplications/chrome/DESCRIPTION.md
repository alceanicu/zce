# ZCE - Exam Simulator for [Zend PHP Engineer Certification](https://www.zend.com/en/services/certification/php-certification)

This application serves as a practice exam to help anyone who are about to take the Zend PHP Certification.

A total of 800 questions are available, ranging from topics in PHP5 to PHP7.1. Just like the real exam, questions are always provided in random order, so that when re-taking the exam, a different set of questions are provided for you. Answer options are also randomised to make sure you understand the correct answer rather than the order of answers during the next time you see the question again.

I believe that one of the most effective ways to increase the chances of passing the exam is to learn from your mistakes in practice exams, just like this one! But your best friend for this will always be PHP.NET.

From version 1.0.2 you can export tests in PDF format, tests can have 5 or 10 random questions.
