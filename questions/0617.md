When writing CLI scripts it is often useful to access the standard streams available to the operating system such as standard input/output and error.
How does one access these streams in PHP 5/7?

- [x] STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR constants in PHP 5/7
- [ ] Use stdin(), stdout() and stderr() functions
- [ ] PHP::STDIN, PHP::STDOUT, PHP::STDERR class constants in PHP 5/7
- [ ] use the php::stdin(), php::stdout(), and php::stderr() class methods
