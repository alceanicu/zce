Consider the following PHP code segment, which attempts to execute a PDO query:

```php
try {
        $dbh->exec($sql);
} catch (PDOException $e) {
        // display warning message
        $info = $e->errorInfo;
}
```
In the event of a PDOException, $info is set with the contents of the $errorInfo property of the exception.
