#### Answer: A

Explanation:

The not-identical equivalence operation (`!==`) evaluates to true if the two operands are not of the same data type or do not have the same value.

Equivalence operations in PHP

There are four types of equivalence operations in the PHP language:

`Equivalence Operation` (`==`): It evaluates to true if the two operands are equivalent, i.e., they can be converted to a common data type in which they have the same value but are not necessarily of the same type.

`Identity Operation` (`===`): It evaluates to true only if the operands are of the same data type and have the same value.

`Not-equivalent Operation` (`!=`): It evaluates to true if the two operands are not equivalent, without regards to their data type.

`Not-identical Operation` (`!==`): It evaluates to true if the two operands are not of the same data type or do not have the same value.
