When migrating the following code from PHP 4 to PHP 5, what should be changed?
```php
class MyClass {
    function MyClass($param) {
        # Do something with $param
        $this->_doSomething($param);
    }
    // Private method to MyClass
    function _doSomething($param)  {
        # Do something with $param
    }
}

class AnotherClass extends MyClass {
    var $param = "foo";
    function AnotherClass()  {
        parent::MyClass($this->param);
    }
}
```

- [x] Access modifiers should be added to methods
- [x] The Constructors for the objects should both be renamed to __construct
- [ ] The use of the parent keyword has changed to 'super'
- [ ] Constructors must have the same parameter lists
