When opening a file in writing mode using the FTP handler, what must be done so that the file will still be written to the server in the event it previously exists?




- [x] Provide a context for fopen() using stream_context_create()

- [ ] You must delete the file first before uploading a new file

- [ ] Configure this behavior in the php.ini file using the ftp.overwrite directive

- [ ] Open the file using the 'w+' mode
