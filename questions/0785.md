What is displayed when the following code is executed?


```php
class ComparedCollection {
    private $es;
    private function __construct($es) {
        $this->es = $es;
    } 
	
    public function include(?int $number) {
        $this->es[] = $number ?? ($number <=> 0);
    }
	
    public function list() {
        return $this->es;
    }	
	
    public static function new() {
        return new self([]);
    }
}

$c = ComparedCollection::new();
$c->include(-5);
$c->include(0);
$c->include(null);
$c->include(5);
print_r($c->list());
```

- [ ] A) Array([0] => -5, [1] => 0, [2] => 0, [3] => 5);
- [ ] B) A parse error because "list", "new" and "include" are reserved PHP keywords;
- [ ] C) A parse error because constructors cannot be declared "private";
- [ ] D) A runtime error because "null" cannot be used when the type-hint "?int";
