Consider the following PHP script:
```php
$a = 5; 
$b = 10; 
function Mul() {
    // ???? 
} 
Mul();
print($b); 
```
What can you write instead of **// ????** on line 4 to get the output 50? Each correct answer represents a complete solution. Choose all that apply.

- [x] A
```php
global $a, $b; $b = $a * $b;
```

- [x] B
```php
$GLOBALS['b'] = $GLOBALS['a'] * $GLOBALS['b'];
```

- [ ] C
```php
globals($b = $a * $b);
```

- [ ] D
```php
$b = $a * $b;
```
