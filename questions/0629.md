Consider the following code snippet:

```php
$query = "SELECT first, last, phone
          FROM contacts
          WHERE first LIKE 'John%'";

$statement = mysqli_prepare($link, $query);
mysqli_execute($statement);

/* ???? */

while (($result = mysqli_stmt_fetch($statement))) {
    print "Name: $first $last\n";
    print "Phone: $phone\n\n";
}
```
Assuming this code snippet is part of a larger correct application, what must be done in place of the ???? above for the correct output to be displayed?

- [x] A while loop, fetching the row and assigning $first, $last, and $phone the proper value
- [ ] None of the above
- [ ] mysqli_fetch_columns($first, $last, $phone);
- [ ] mysqli_stmt_bind_result($statement, $first, $last, $phone);
