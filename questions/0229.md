Consider a string in the following format:
```php
a*bcd/a.d
```
You want to perform regular expression in this string; however, you are unable to do this since the string contains special characters. You can make this string PCRE compatible if you convert this string in the following format:
```php
a\*bcd\/a\.d
```
Which of the following functions will you use to accomplish the task into a single call?

- [x] A
```php
preg_quote()
```

- [ ] B
```php
preg_match()
```

- [ ] C
```php
preg_split()
```

- [ ] D
```php
explode()
```
