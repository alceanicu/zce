What is the result of the following code?

```php
$x = new class extends \stdClass {
    function getName() {
	    return 'PHP';
	}
};
echo $x->getName();
```

- [x] PHP
- [ ] A fatal error because \stdClass is a special class that cannot be used directly
- [ ] A warning saying than all anonymous class must be declared public
- [ ] A fatal error because anonymous classes cannot inherit from other classes
