Consider the following code snippet:

```php
$query = "INSERT INTO mytable (myinteger, mydouble, myblob, myvarchar)
              VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)";
$statement = mysqli_prepare($link, $query);
if (!$statement) {
        die(mysqli_error($link));
}
 /* The variables being bound to by MySQLi don't need to exist prior to binding */
 mysqli_bind_param($statement, "idbs", $myinteger, $mydouble, $myblob, $myvarchar);
 /* ???????????? */   
/* execute the query, using the variables as defined. */
if (!mysqli_execute($statement)) {
        die(mysqli_error($link));
}
```
Assuming this snippet is a smaller part of a correctly written script, what actions must occur in place of the ????? in the above code snippet to insert a row with the following values: 10, 20.2, foo, string ?

- [ ] A) Assign $myinteger, $mydouble, $myblob, $myvarchar the proper values
- [ ] B) A transaction must be begun and the variables must be assigned
- [ ] C) Each value must be assigned prior to calling mysqli_bind_param(), and thus nothing should be done
- [ ] D) Use mysqli_bind_value() to assign each of the values
