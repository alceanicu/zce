What is wrong with the following code?

```php
function duplicate($obj) {
    $newObj = $obj;
    return $newObj;
}
$a = new MyClass();
$a_copy = duplicate($a);

$a->setValue(10);
$a_copy->setValue(20);
```

- [x] You must use the clone operator to make a copy of an object
- [ ] You must use return &$newObj instead
- [ ] There is nothing wrong with this code
- [ ] duplicate() must accept its parameter by reference
