What is the result of the following code?
```php
function foo(string $a, ?string $b) : ?int {
    return $b ? $a <=> $b : null;
}
echo foo('PHP', 7);
```

- [x] 1
- [ ] A type error because function should return int but instade return string;
- [ ] 0
- [ ] A syntax error because ?string and ?int does not exist in PHP7
