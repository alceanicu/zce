What output will this code produce ?

```php
class Disney {
    public $cartoon;
    function __construct($cartoon) {
        $this->cartoon = $cartoon;
    }
}

$disney = new Disney("The Beauty and The Beast");
$waltDisney = $disney;
$waltDisney->cartoon = "Pinocchio";
echo $disney->cartoon;
```

- [x] "Pinocchio" because $waltDisney and $Disney are pointing to the same object
- [ ] "The Beauty and The Beast" because the $cartoon property in the $waltDisney object was changed
- [ ] NULL because the Disney class was not instanciated inside the $waltDisney variable
- [ ] an error
