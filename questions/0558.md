Consider the following code block:

```php
function &myFunction() {
    $string = "MyString";
    var_dump($string);

    return ($undefined);
}
for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) {
    $retval = myFunction();
}
```
This code block's behavior has changed between PHP 4 and PHP 5. Why?

- [ ] A) None of the above
- [ ] B) This could would cause an automatic segmentation fault in PHP 4
- [ ] C) This code would throw a syntax error in PHP 4
- [ ] D) Returning an undefined variable by reference in PHP 4 would cause eventual memory corruption
