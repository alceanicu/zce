Is the following PHP code valid or will it generate an error, warning or notice?

```php
error_reporting(E_ALL | E_STRICT);
$newArray[E_STRICT] = 'foo';
```

- [x] Yes, it's completely valid
- [ ] Invalid, you must define $newArray by calling array() first
- [ ] Invalid, E_STRICT is not defined
- [ ] Invalid, you cannot use a constant as an array key
