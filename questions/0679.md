Assuming every method call below returns an instance of an object, how can the following be re-written in PHP 7?

```php
$a = new MyClass();
$b = $a->getInstance();
$c = $b->doSomething();
```

- [x]  $c = $a->getInstance()->doSomething();

- [x]  $c = (new MyClass())->getInstance()->doSomething();

- [ ]  $c = ((MyClass)$a->getInstance())->doSomething();

- [ ]  This cannot be re-written in PHP 7
