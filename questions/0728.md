Is there a way to make E_NOTICE type errors behave like fatal errors in PHP and therefor stop script execution when such an error occurs ?

- [x] By setting a custom error handler, one can alter the way PHP treats E_NOTICE errors and then stop the script.
- [ ] There's no way to do that. Notices are exactly what their name states: Notices.
- [ ] By using the "register_shutdown_function()" a developer can stop script execution at any time, including when notices are thrown.
- [ ] All are incorect
