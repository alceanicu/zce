Consider the following code, stored inside the myInclude.php file.
```php
$foo = "Bar";
return $foo;
```
What happens when you include this script from another script (main.php), given that myInclude.php is calling return when not inside a function.

- [x] The value "Bar" is the returned to main.php as the result of the include.
- [ ] Both myInclude.php and main.php finish execution immediately
- [ ] Syntax error, you can't return outside of a function
- [ ] none of above
