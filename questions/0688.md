Why is it important from a security perspective to never display PHP error messages directly to the end user, yet always log them?




- [x] Error messages give the perception of insecurity to the user

- [x] Error messages can contain data useful to a potential attacker

- [ ] Error messages will contain sensitive session information

- [ ] Error messages can contain cross site scripting attacks
