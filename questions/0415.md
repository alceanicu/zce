Using htmlspecialchars() is useful for preventing malicious JavaScript from executing, as well as for generating valid HTML. What is the output of the following script?

```php
$str = <<<EOF
<p>me & you
EOF;
echo htmlspecialchars($str);
```

- [x] &lt;p&gt;me &amp; you
- [ ] <p>me & you
- [ ] <p>me &amp you
- [ ] <p>me &amp; you
