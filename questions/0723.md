What happens when the script below is executed ?
```php
$a = array(1,2,3);
$b = array(7,8,9);

$counta = count($a);
$countb = sizeof($b);

if ($counta===$countb) {
    echo "They are equal and have the same type";
} else {
    echo "They are not equal or they are not of the same type";
}
```

- [x] The script returns "They are equal and have the same type"
- [ ] The script returns "They are not equal or they are not of the same type"
- [ ] The script fails because the sizeof() function doesn't exist
- [ ] an error
