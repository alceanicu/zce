Take a look at the following code

```php
function myFunction($a) {
	$a++;
}
$b = 1;
myFunction($b);
```
hat code do you need to replace so that $b has the value 2 at the end of the script? (May be multiple answers)

- [ ] A) Line 01: Replace $a with &$a
- [ ] B) Line 02: Replace $a++ with $a += 2;
- [ ] C) Line 02: Replace $a++ with $a *= 2;
- [ ] D) Line 05: Replace $b with &$b
