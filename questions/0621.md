Consider the following code snippet:

```php
$link = mysqli_connect("hostname", "username", "password");
if (!$link) {
    /* $error = ??????; */
    die("Could not connect to the database: $error");
}
```
What would go in place of the ???? above for this script to function properly?

- [x]  mysqli_connect_error();

- [ ]  mysqli_connect_error($link);

- [ ]  mysqli_error();

- [ ]  $_MySQL['connect_error']
