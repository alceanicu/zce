What is wrong in the following code (assume that $db is an instance of mysqli, mytable exists and has a column called student):

```php
$sql = "SELECT student FROM mytable WHERE student = '$_POST["student"]'";
if ($result = $db->query($sql)) {
    while($row = $result->fetch_object())
        echo $row->student;
}
```

- [x] The script is vulnerable to SQL Injection
- [ ] Nothing is wrong
- [ ] An XSS atack
- [ ] It is not PHP 7 valid code
