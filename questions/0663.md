What is the best way to ensure that a user-defined function is always passed an object as its single parameter?

- [x]  function myfunction(stdClass $a)

- [ ]  function myfunciton($a = stdClass)

- [ ]  Use is_object() within the function

- [ ]  There is no way to ensure the parameter will be an object
