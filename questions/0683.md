How can one take advantage of the time waiting for a lock during a stream access, to do other tasks using the following locking code as the base:

```php
$retval = flock($fr, LOCK_EX);
```

- [x] Use LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB instead of LOCK_EX
- [ ] Use flock_lazy() instead of flock()
- [ ] Use LOCK_UN instead of LOCK_EX
- [ ] Check the value of $retval to see if the lock was obtained
