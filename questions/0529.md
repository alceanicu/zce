Consider the following script:
```php
$oranges = 10;
$apples = 5;
$string = "I have %d apples and %d oranges";
/* ??????? */
```
What could be placed in place of ?????? to output the string:
```php
I have 5 apples and 10 oranges
```

- [x]  printf($string, $apples, $oranges);

- [ ]  str_format($string, $apples, $oranges);

- [ ]  print($string, $apples, $oranges);

- [ ]  print sprintf($apples, $oranges);
