What will happen when the following code is executed?

```php
interface Additionable {
    public function add($x, $y);
}

function average ($a, $b) {
    $anon = new class implements Additionable {
        public function divide($x, $y) {
            return $x / $y;
        }
        public function add($x, $y) {
            return $x + $y;
        }
    };
	
    $sum = $anon->add($a, $b);
    $average = $anon->divide($sum, 2);
    return $average;
}
echo average(10, 70);
```

- [x] The code will work and '40' will be printed;
- [ ] The code will work and 'null' will be printed;
- [ ] A fatal error because anonymous class cannot implements interfaces;
- [ ] A fatal error because anonymous class should be declared using the "anonymousclas" keyword;
