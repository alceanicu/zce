Given the following code:

```php
Interface Verifiable {
   public function verify();
}

Class Cheque {
   public function verify() {
      return true;
   }
}

Class CurrencyCheque extends Cheque implements Verifiable 
{
    // interesting stuff happens
}

$obj = new CurrencyCheque();
```
What happens when we instantiate a CurrencyCheque object?

- [x] A new CurrencyCheque object is created
- [ ] An warning because the interface isn't implemented
- [ ] The method must be redefined in CurrencyCheque
- [ ] An error that the interface must be defined in the parent object
