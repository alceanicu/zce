Give the following code?


```php
try {
   // ...
} catch (MyEx1 $e) {
    logError($e);
} catch (MyEx2 $e) {
    logError($e);
} catch (MyEx3 $e) {
    logError($e);
}
```
Since all "catch" blocks have the same code, how can you avoid duplication hear?

- [x] "catch(MyEx1 | MyEx2 | MyEx3 $e)";
- [ ] By replacing the "catch" blocks with one "finally" block;
- [ ] By catching any like this: "catch(Exception $e)";
- [ ] "catch(MyEx1, MyEx2, MyEx3 $e)";
