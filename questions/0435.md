How would you parse a web page at http://example.com/page.php as XML?

- [x] DOMDocument::loadHTML(file_get_contents('http://example.com/page.php'));
- [ ] You can't; it must be well-formed XML.
- [ ] DOMDocument::loadFile('http://example.com/page.php');
- [ ] simple_xml_load_html('http://example.com/page.php');
