What is displayed when the following code is executed?


```php
abstract class A {
    abstract public function f();
}

(new anonymousclass extends A {
    public function f() {
        echo 'Hello World';
    }
})->f();
```

- [ ] A) A parse error because the "anonymousclass" keyword does not exist in PHP;
- [ ] B) A parse error because anonymous classes cannot extends abstract class;
- [ ] C) A runtime error because you must first store anonymous class in a variable before calling methods on it;
- [ ] D) Hello World
