What is the best approach for converting this string:


```php
$string = "a=10&b[]=20&c=30&d=40+50";

// Into this array?

array(- [ ] {
      ["a"]=>
      string(- [ ] "10"
      ["b"]=>
      array(- [ ] {
        [0]=>
        string(- [ ] "20"
      }
      ["c"]=>
      string(- [ ] "30"
      ["d"]=>
      string(- [ ] "40 50"
}
```

- [x] Use the parse_str() function to translate it to an array()
- [ ] Write a parser completely by hand, it's the only way to make sure it's 100% accurate
- [ ] Pass the variable to another PHP script via an HTTP GET request and return the array as a serialized variable
- [ ] Just call unserialize() to translate it to an array()
