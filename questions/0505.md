What is the result of the following code?

```php
echo (new anonymousclass {
    function foo() {
	    return ['5', '7', '1'];
	}
})->foo()[0][0];
```

- [x] an error
- [ ] 5
- [ ] an syntax error because the anonymousclass does not have a constructor
- [ ] an syntax error because the anonymousclass keyword does not exist
