What is the result of the following code?

```php
echo (new anonymousclass {
  function foo() {
    return ['5', '7', '1'];
  }
})->foo()[0][0];
```

- [ ] 7
- [ ] 5
- [ ] an syntax error because the anonymousclass does not have a constructor
- [x] an syntax error because the anonymousclass keyword does not exist (new class exist)
