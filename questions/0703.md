Which of the statements about traits below are true ?

- [x] An inherited member from a base class is overridden by a member inserted by a Trait, but members from the current class override Trait methods.
- [ ] If two Traits insert a method with the same name in a class that uses them, a fatal error is produced and this naming conflict can not be bypassed
- [ ] All variants are true
