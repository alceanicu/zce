PHP assigns non-object variables by value, but you can "connect" one variable to another so assignment occurs by reference instead. What is output of the following PHP script?

```php
$a = 15;
$b = $a;
$b = 25;
$c = 50;
$d = &$c;
$d = 25;
echo $a . ' - ' . $c;
```
Enter the exact script output

- [x] 15 - 25
- [x] 15 
- [ ] 50 - 25
- [ ] 25 - 25
