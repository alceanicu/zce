Assuming that the code below is in a file named "test.php" and that PHP has full rights over the file, what happens if the file is executed from the command line without any arguments ?

```php
exec("rm -f " . dirname(__FILE__) . "/" .  $argv[0]);
```

- [x] The file test.php is deleted
- [ ] The script exits without doing anything
- [ ] A notice is thrown because $argv[0] is not defined and the script fails.
- [ ] an error
