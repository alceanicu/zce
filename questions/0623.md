What is the output of the following code?

```php
class MyException extends Exception {}
class AnotherException extends MyException {}

class Foo {
    public function something() {
        throw new AnotherException();
    }
    public function somethingElse() {
        throw new MyException();
    }
}

$a = new Foo();

try {
    try {
        $a->something();
    } catch(AnotherException $e) {
        $a->somethingElse();
    } catch(MyException $e) {
        print "Caught Exception";
    }
} catch(Exception $e) {
    print "Didn't catch the Exception!";
}
```

- [x] "Didn't catch the Exception!"
- [ ] "Caught Exception" followed by "Didn't catch the Exception!"
- [ ] A fatal error for an uncaught exception
- [ ] "Didn't catch the Exception!" followed by a fatal error
