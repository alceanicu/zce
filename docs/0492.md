Given a class called SoapFunctions and a working WSDL for the methods in that class, what needs to be added to the code below to serve those methods over SOAP?

```php
require("SoapFunctions.php");
$s = new SoapServer($wsdl);
$s->handle();
```

- [x] $s->setClass("SoapFunctions");
- [ ] $s->setHandler("SoapFunctions");
- [ ] set_soap_class($s, "SoapFunctions");
- [ ] set_soap_handler($s, "SoapFunctions");
