Assuming every method call below returns an instance of an object, how can the following be re-written in PHP5/7?
```php
$a = new MyClass();
$b = $a->getInstance();
$c = $b->doSomething();
```

- [x] A
```php
$c = $a->getInstance()->doSomething();
```

- [ ] B
```php
$c = ((MyClass)$a->getInstance())->doSomething();
```

- [ ] C
```php
$c = (MyClass)$a->getInstance();
```

- [ ] This cannot be re-written in PHP5/7.
