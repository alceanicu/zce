When defining a custom sorting callback for functions such as usort(), uksort() or uasort(), you must return 0 if two elements are considered equal. Which of the following statements best describes how PHP treats equal elements during sorting?

- [x] The order is undefined, meaning you cannot guarantee which element appears first in the sorted array
- [ ] The element which was first in the unsorted array will be first in the sorted array
- [ ] PHP randomly sorts equal elements to decide their order in the sorted array
- [ ] PHP automatically sorts equal elements using the same algorithm as sort() to decide their order in the sorted array
