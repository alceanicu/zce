Consider the following code:
```php
$a;
for($a = 1; $a <= 100; $a++) Â {
    if ($a == 50) {
        continue;
    }
    print($a);
}
```
What will be the output of the program?

- [x] A series from 1 to 100 will be printed. The number 50 will not be printed.
- [ ] A series from 1 to 50 will be printed.
- [ ] A series from 51 to 100 will be printed.
