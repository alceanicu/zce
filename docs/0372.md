What is the primary difference between array_key_exists() and isset() when checking to see if a given array element exists?


- [x] isset() will return false if the key exists but has a null value
- [ ] isset() will trigger a PHP warning if the element doesn't exist
- [ ] array_key_exists() is faster
- [ ] isset() will create an empty value in the array if it doesn't exist
